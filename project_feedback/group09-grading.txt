-------------------------------------------------
System Description & Implementation (15/20pt)

- solid overall network layout
- mostly good and detailed security design

System design & description (SD, 4.5/7pt):
- CA private key on live system [e.g., no intermediate CA used] (-1)
- user private key unencrypted in PKCS12 archive? unclear whether these are stored on CA server or can be downloaded only once (-.5)
- unclear whether additional password authentication of CA server and web server to DB server adds any security (both private key and password must be stored on the former servers)
- session management: unclear whether any cookie attributes are set (-.5)
- components: their interfaces are hardly described (-.5)

Implementation (IMP, 6.5/9pt):
- system apparently somewhat unstable and very slow
- SSH into backup machine does not work (-.5)
- unclear whether CRL is signed (-1)
- logout does not invalidate cookie (-.5)
- DB server password hard-coded in script (-.5)

Presentation (P, 4/4pt):
- fine, but only relative sparse use of security principles

-------------------------------------------------
Risk Analysis (15/20pt)

Assets (A, 1/3pt):
- missing logical assets: users' private keys, passwords (should be listed separately, as thy have different properties), server private keys, certificates, public keys, CRL, logs, configuration, backup (-1)
- security properties are missing for most assets; some given security properties concern different assets (e.g., how can a safe or server be confidential?) (-1)
- missing assets: intangible goods (reputation, confidence etc.)

Threat Sources (TS, 3/3pt):
- fairly comprehensive list of threat sources
- could include investigations targets, which could subsume gov agencies and organized crime

Risk definitions (RD, 2/2pt):
- fine

Risk evaluation (RE, 4/7pt):
- no risk evaluations for missing logical assets and intangible goods (-1.5)
- web server: what about other common web app vulnerabilities (CSRF, session hijacking, XSS, SSTI, path traversal, ....) (-1)
- CA server and backup server SW: other threats? (-.5)
- risk acceptance, #6: how can Tor help if physical Internet access is blocked?

Presentation (P, 5/5pt):
- fine
